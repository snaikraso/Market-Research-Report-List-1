<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Steam Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float type (Lever Float and Free Float)</li><li>Inverted Bucket type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical steam trap market primarily features float type traps, which include lever float and free float designs, as well as inverted bucket traps. Lever float traps utilize a lever mechanism to open and close the discharge orifice based on water levels, while free float traps operate with a buoyant float that directly controls discharge. Inverted bucket traps, on the other hand, use a bucket that inverts when steam enters, allowing condensate to be expelled while trapping steam. These designs enhance efficiency in steam systems.</p></p>
